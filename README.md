### Product Summary 
	As students, we understand that managing time can be one of the greatest obstacles in obtaining success. It is easy to be overwhelmed with homework, projects, and exams, and we want to provide students with the necessary resources to help effectively manage their time to get their work done successfully. Our application is a time management tool that allows users to list out all their tasks that need to get done, and prioritizes those tasks based on a selected criteria. We believe this simple tool will help guide students down the path of success, giving them the flexibility to choose how they want to get things done.
