### Product Summary 
> As students, we understand that managing time can be one of the greatest obstacles in obtaining success. It is easy to be overwhelmed with homework, projects, and exams, and we want to provide students with the necessary resources to help effectively manage their time to get their work done successfully. Our application is a time management tool that allows users to list out all their tasks that need to get done, and prioritizes those tasks based on a selected criteria. We believe this simple tool will help guide students down the path of success, giving them the flexibility to choose how they want to get things done. 


### Open Source Commitment: QT Software + Library
> We want our product to be freely accessible for all types of audiences, therefore are offering our product as open source. We supported the Open Source cause by integrating other open source software, such as QT. QT is a cross-platform IDE and design tool that helps programmers build frontend implementations with ease. The Prioritizer utilizes its UI features to help build a easy to use interface for our users.

### Licensing
> QT5 software and libraries were primarily used to develop our project, which are licensed under the GPL and LGPLv3 license, so our project must be published under the same license as it is a derivative work of this software.

### Build Compatibility
> Our application runs on Windows + Linux.
